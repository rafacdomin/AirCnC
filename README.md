# About 

Node.js server developed on the Omnistack 9 offered by RocketSeat, where we made an AirBnB copy that aims to list locations/rooms that companies are offering to people work.

The project contains a server, developed with Node.js, that comunicates the front-end (web and mobile) to database. Also one Web Page, developed with React, where users can add or remove companies, and one Mobile Client, developed with React Native, where people can submit a request to these companies.
