# About 

NodeJS, ReactJS and React Native project developed on the Omnistack 9 offered by RocketSeat, where we made an AirBnB copy that aims to list locations/rooms that companies are offering to people work.

The project contains a server, developed with Node.js, that comunicates the front-end (web and mobile) to database in MongoDB. Also one Web Page, developed with React, where users can add companies, and a Mobile Client, developed with React Native, where people can submit a request to these companies.
